# Kernel-Simulator
a sophisticated Kernel Simulator running on the JVM.It exposes low-level OS functionalities—such as Process Scheduling, Memory Management, and Inter-Process Communication (IPC)—via high-level REST APIs.The goal of this project was to bridge the gap between theoretical OS concepts(Semaphores, Paging, and Deadlocks)and practical software engineering.
